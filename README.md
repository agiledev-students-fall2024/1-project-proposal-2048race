# Project Proposal - 2048 Racing

### What and why?

This project will enable two people to race in the classic 2048 game, and every 15 seconds, players will be able to click on an opponent's screen to flip a number to 2, provided that those numbers are not the 2 biggest.

### For whom?

The end-users are people who like to play games.

### How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

Players will be able to request a match once they open the website. The active players will see their 2048 board on the left side of their screen and their opponent's board on the right side of their screen. Players will play 2048 as usual, but will be able to edit their opponent's board every 15 seconds. 

This project will be a nice study on concurrency, web sockets, and race conditions.


### Scope

The need for web sockets and the need to handle race conditions gives this project enough complexity so that it takes 4-6 students 2 months to complete.
